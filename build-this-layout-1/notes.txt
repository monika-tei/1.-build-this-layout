Build this layout, part 1

Recreate some of this layout using only functional components

At this point we do NOT care about the content

So if you have created a component that does something, but the content in the assignment is different, it doesn't matter


import CTA from "./CTA";

export default function Left() {
  return (
    <section className="grid-left">
      <h1>Blockchain finally made accessible </h1>
      <h5>Unleash the potential of blockchain to making business secure, scalable and accessible</h5>
      <CTA />
    </section>
  );
}
